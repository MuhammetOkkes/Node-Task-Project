# Task Manager With Node.js
 - I used mongodb atlas as a database in my project.
 - I have asynchronous functions getAllTasks,createTask,getTask,update Task,deleteTask in my project. 
 - These functions, which take request and response as parameters, return responses according to the appropriate status code.
