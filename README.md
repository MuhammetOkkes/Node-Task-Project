# Task Manager With Node.js
 - I used MongoDB Atlas cloud database in my project.
 - I have asynchronous functions getAllTasks,createTask,getTask,update Task,deleteTask in my project. 
 - These functions, which take request and response as parameters, return responses according to the appropriate status code.
 - We can list the tasks in my project, we can create the task, we can list the task according to the Id. Again, we can update or delete the tasks according to the Id .
